# Prodigy InfoTech Internship: Data Analysis Insights

Welcome to the Prodigy InfoTech Internship repository! This repository documents my journey through Task 1 of the internship, which focuses on data cleaning, analysis, and uncovering insightful patterns.

## Task Overview

Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the disctribution of ages or genders in a population. For this task, I chose to visualize the population growth of India from 1980 to 2021 using a bar chart.

## Knowledge Gained

Through this task, I improved my ability to:

* Clean and preprocess data using pandas.
* Create visualizations, such as bar charts, using matplotlib.
* Analyze and interpret population demographics data.
* Present data insights clearly and effectively.

## Steps Explained 

1. Import Libraries: Use pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib.pyplot for creating visualizations.
2. Load the Dataset: The data is loaded from an Excel file located in the specified path.
3. Initial Data Inspection: The first 100 rows, a summary, and information about the dataset are displayed to understand its structure.
4. Filter Data for India: We extract the population data specifically for India.
5. Prepare Data for Plotting: The population data is transposed to make the years the index, and the column is renamed to 'Population'.
6. Create Bar Chart: A bar chart is plotted to visualize the population growth of India from 1980 to 2021.

## Conclusion

This task provided hands-on experience in data visualization, helping to convey complex data insights in a clear and visually appealing manner. The bar chart effectively showcases the population growth trend in India over four decades.
